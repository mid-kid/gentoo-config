Excempt timezone setting from privacy.resistFingerprinting

It's very easy to tell when a browser has resistFingerprinting enabled, so
distinguishing myself from this significant crowd probably makes this option
very ineffective. However, the TZ=UTC override is a *very* significant
usability issue, so this tradeoff is worth it to me.

A different way to patch this out after building is:
# r2 -w /usr/lib64/firefox/libxul.so
> / TZ=UTC
> s hit0_0
> w0 1
> q
